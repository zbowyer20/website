		<p class="story__paragraph">She was very pretty. It was like she was dressed up for the occasion too. Whereas the guys had been abducted in their usual clothes (though Kevin always looked swish), and Victoria was in a dinner dress, the dress Kate was in gave off the ‘girl next door’ vibe, an attire not too formal but not overly casual either. He had to admit she was very attractive.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">He also had to admit, though, that the way she was staring at everybody, unable to speak, was just as unsettling as she was attractive.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Zak, unusually, was the first to pipe up. “What are you doing here?” he asked.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Kate blocked herself, putting her hand against the other arm. “I don’t know,” she answered, avoiding his gaze.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“I think what he’s asking is were you taken, like the rest of us?” Kevin interjected.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Mmm,” Kate nodded.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“We don’t know ya. We all know each other,” Victoria murmured. “What’re you doing here?”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Oh, I know you,” Kate said, smiling up at Victoria, then quickly dodging direct eye contact.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“You do?” Kevin coaxed, eyebrow raised.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Yeah,” Kate began. “You’re Victoria,” she said, nodding at Victoria. “And you’re Kevin… you’re Zak… you’re Joe, and you’re Tom,”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Kevin drew his head back. “Uh –“ he gasped, staggered, then looked around at the others. “Do any of you know who this is?” He asked. Tom shook his head, eyes on Kate, as did Zak, Victoria shrugged, Joe said a quick no – and Kevin drew back to Kate. “So how do you know us?”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“I’ve seen the photos,” Kate answered, smiling nervously at the group. </p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Kevin’s eyebrow rose so high Tom wondered whether it would reach his hairline. “Photos? Of us?” Kevin asked.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Oh, not like that. Not creepy or anything. Online,” Kate said as though she were correcting something, giggling slightly.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Online where?” Kevin continued, patience wearing thin.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Oh, sorry. I know your friend. Sophie. We work together. And I see all the pictures and things she puts online. She’s told me about all of you too. Something about Tom throwing a big strop?” she said, then held her hand against her mouth, shocked about what she had just said. “Oh my God! I’m sorry! She didn’t actually say that!”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Kevin laughed and Tom felt anger bubbling like acid inside his stomach. Clearly it was apparently on his face, because Kevin turned to Tom and said, “What? It’s true!”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Tom could do nothing but face away. He felt Kate’s concerned eyes on him. “Sorry,” she said again, and Tom gave the slightest shake of the head back.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“That sounds like something Sophie would say,” Kevin smirked, relaxing. “So you were taken just like us. She’s here, by the way, she’s right upstairs,”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Yeah, I saw her!” Victoria added.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Kate’s eyes lit up. “Really! She’s been missing for yonks!”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Yeah, she’s right here, right upstairs she is!” Victoria smiled.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“You said your name was Kate?” Zak asked.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Mmm,” Kate smiled to him. “It’s nice to meet you Zak. Sophie talked about you a lot,”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Zak smiled widely to the rest of the group. “There’s a lot about me to talk about!” He said smugly. “What did she say?” He asked, suddenly suspicious.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Oh, all good things, nothing bad!” Kate nodded enthusiastically.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“What else could there be?” Zak asked rhetorically, eyes clamped shut in collaboration with his big cheesy smile.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Okay, Kate,” Kevin walked forwards. “Do you know any way outta here?” He asked.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">She frowned, eyes moving to the side to think. “Well that’s what I was looking for, actually. I haven’t found anywhere. But there are these things next to doors. They’ve got letters on them. I put my hand in one upstairs and something bit me, but it opened the door after!”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Victoria’s eyes grew huge. “Something BIT you?” She asked, immediately alert.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Yeah!” Kate confirmed, and Victoria threw her head into her hands.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Are ya sure it wasn’t a needle?” Joe asked, trying to see her arm, where the pinprick assumedly was.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Kate looked up at the ceiling as she considered that. “Yeah, I guess it could have been,”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Oh gawd, don’t scare me like that again Kate,” Victoria groaned. She sounded like she was about to throw up. Tom noticed that Kate had to stifle a giggle. It was kind of funny. Victoria really was terrified of snakes for some reason.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“There were two outside this room, actually. They said K and three I think. I don’t really know what that means, I tried putting my arm in them but nothing happened,” </p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“I think that was probably a Z?” Tom suggested. “We went past that door too,”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Oh, yes, you’re probably right,” Kate agreed.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Without warning, Zak fell forward against the bar and retched, making a guttural sound that seemed to rise from his stomach. Joe literally jumped back while Kate’s face fell, her mouth making a long O. Kevin, on the other hand, came forward, putting his hand at the top of Zak’s back in a maternal way. “You okay?” he asked.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Zak groaned and flew away from the bar, dropping to the wall where a backpack with dark blue straps, bordered with black felt, lay. He shakily opened the zip of the backpack and dug into it. Moaning, he sighed, “Don’t look, I think I’m gonna be sick,”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Kate’s hands went straight over her eyes and Victoria grimaced, looking away and holding her nose. “Oh, no!” she cried. Kevin, meanwhile, maintained his sympathetic look, not perturbed but the looming threat of oncoming vomit. Tom’s heart went to Zak too – he’d had a troubling tickle of nausea since he’d arrived in the room – but he really wanted to step away. Though Zak tried to hide it behind his crouched body, Tom saw the top of a long, thin syringe that he was holding. Zak pulled up the sleeve of his navy blue jumper and Tom was able to see the forceful motion of Zak’s arm as he injected himself with the needle. Immediately the tension in the room settled as Zak took a long, relieved, deep breath and bowed his head, immediately relaxed. He subtly withdrew the syringe and put it back in the bag and then, after giving himself a moment of respite, stood up and turned around to face everybody, smiling.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Is it over yet?” Kate asked, peeking through her fingers.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“I’m good,” Zak confirmed, taking sharp, short breaths. Kate breathed a sigh of relief and pulled her hands from her face.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“What was that then?” Kevin asked, eyes focused on the bag. He too had spotted the syringe.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“I was feeling sick,” Zak answered, resting his head on his arms at the bar.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“What was that injection about?” Kevin pushed further.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“It just makes me feel better. It’s a blood sugar thing,” Zak said, shrugging. “It happens sometimes. I guess whoever took us knew that and prepared me,”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“I never knew you had diabetes,” Kevin said. There was something in his voice that made Tom think Kevin had doubts.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“It’s not diabetes, it’s something else, something kinda small, no big deal, I just have to do that sometimes if I’m not eating the right sort of stuff,” Zak said, smiling lightly at Kevin.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“My sister had the same sort of thing,” Kate said. “It was horrible,”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Yeah, it is,” Zak nodded. The colour started to return to his face, which was pale enough normally anyway.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Okay, let’s get out of here. This place gives me the creeps. I can feel the ghosts here,” Kevin shivered.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“There aren’t ghosts here,” Victoria spoke up. Everybody looked at her. Tom heard Joe quietly ask Zak if he was okay.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Have you been conducting séances?” Kevin asked jokingly. Kate’s brow furrowed. She did make some exaggerated faces.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“No, I ain’t—“ Victoria began before Kate interrupted her.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“What’s a séance?” She asked before realizing her rudeness. “Oh, sorry, go on!” she motioned to Victoria.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“It’s where you sit at a table and talk to ghosts sweetheart,” Kevin told her, smiling.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“I see ‘em,” Victoria said matter-of-factly.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“You what?” Joe asked, looking at the others to see if they were as shocked as he was.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“I see ghosts. Seen ‘em ever since I was a kid,” Victoria said, looking proud of herself.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Oh, this is getting spooky!” Kate whimpered.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“You’ve always seen ghosts?” Kevin asked.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Yeah, I see ‘em about sometimes,”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“And we’re only just hearing about this?”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Well it ain’t like they’re everywhere. Not like The Sixth Sense. They ain’t as creepy as that either Kate, don’t worry,” Victoria rubbed Kate’s arm reassuringly, who shivered in response. “I see one maybe once a year. Most of ‘em go on to the afterlife I think. Only the ones that get left behind are the ones that’re still here. They’re the ones I see, no others,”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“I don’t think you see ghosts, Victoria. I think you see spooky looking people sometimes,” Kevin rolled his eyes dismissively.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Victoria frowned, annoyance etched on her face. “I do! I always have!” she disputed.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Okay. There aren’t any ghosts here – fine,” Kevin said, looking away from Victoria now. “I still think we need to get out of here. We found two doors right? One with K and Z on it, one with K and T on it. So, Kate, looks like we’ve got our options. One of us can go with Tom into one door and the other can go with Zak,” he said, then mouthed to her, Zak’s the cuter one!, or at least that’s what Tom thought he said. Tom gritted his teeth.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“I don’t know,” Kate murmured.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“What about me!” Victoria grumbled.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Maybe you and Joe can go explore the rest of the prison, see if you can find anywhere else,” Kevin suggested offhandedly.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Victoria seemed happy with this idea. “If it mean I don’t have to put my arm in any more of them slots then…” she said, nodding.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Fine with me,” Joe said, agreeable by nature.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Zak said something very quietly to Kevin who laughed out loud. “Okay, so Zak and Kate together then?” He suggested. Alarm bells started ringing in Tom’s head – he was about to be paired with Kevin.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“I should go with Kate,” Tom said.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Oh!” Kate exclaimed.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Why?” Kevin asked. Behind him, Zak looked disappointed, annoyed maybe. Tom felt a pang of guilt – but this was more important.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“I just should, that’s all,” Tom retaliated, a better excuse missing him entirely.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Kevin’s face fell in irritation. “Is there something you want to say to me?” Kevin asked bluntly, eyes dull with frustration.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Something in the pit of Tom’s stomach stirred; thoughts rushed through his mind like thousands of electrical impulses urging him forwards; his heart rushed, and he nodded vigorously. “Yeah, actually,” he growled quietly. “Over here. Away from them,” he said, and walked to the corner of the room, seeing the concerned and awkward faces of the others following him. Kevin, obviously, gave them his usual little exasperated look and came after Tom, hands on his hips. Tom turned to face him.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“What?” Kevin asked.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Look, I’ll be fine with you while we’re here, while we’re getting out of here, but don’t push it. I know you’re only trying to stick with me to annoy me. Don’t be a dick,” Tom warned.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">A smile of disbelief grew across Kevin’s face. He took a moment to draw himself together and flicked his hair to the side to begin his response. “Wow,” he uttered. “Wow. Tom. You need to grow. Up. We are in the shits right now. And all you can think of, all you’ve ever been thinking of, is about some petty little thing from years ago? Come on. There are more important issues to be dealing with, don’t you think?”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Fuck you!” Tom retaliated. He didn’t even think about what he was saying; the words poured out as a knee-jerk reaction. “Petty little thing? Look, maybe it was a long time ago, but you were a dick then! And you haven’t changed, look at you!”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Kevin was laughing in disbelief, then came to an abrupt stop, eyes staring coldly at him. “You’re blaming me for all this when it’s not even my fault. If anyone’s to blame then it’s Joe, but he’s so perfect to you, isn’t he? Well I don’t blame him for what he did. Maybe he is perfect, which is why he made the right decision in fucking you off! You’ve been such a child in all of this. I would’ve thought, kind of hoped, you’d grown up after all this time. I was hoping maybe we could have a reunion meal next year, get everyone together, but you know what, maybe if we ever do get out of this shithole we’ll just do it the five of us, hell we’ll invite Kate in your place, I think that’d be much better company than having a whiny little bitch there!”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">It was as though he’d pulled a trigger in Tom’s mind. Tom launched forward, throwing a punch square into the side of Kevin’s scrawny face. It almost knocked the guy over – he was the smallest of the group – and he was only able to stay up by balancing himself against his knee, having almost fallen to a crouching position. He rubbed his face, clearly hurt both physically and emotionally. Tom looked over at the group, who were staggered, unable to move by this previously unseen violent side to Tom. He looked back at Kevin, dark red rage still churning through his head, and clenched his hand into a fist again.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“If you fucking try that again I’ll—“ Kevin began, and the words acted as another impulse for Tom, who once more threw his fist forwards, this time catching Kevin on the nose. Kevin jumped back, wincing, now putting both hands to his nose. He glared at Tom, shaking all over. </p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">This was enough to get the others moving; Joe, Zak and Victoria dashed over. Joe went to Kevin’s side, standing in front of him as a shield as he looked at Kevin’s face, while Zak and Victoria both pulled Tom back.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“The hell is wrong with you?” Zak shouted, pulling him roughly back. “Stop it!”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Stop it!” Victoria repeated shakily.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Tom struggled against them viciously, trying to shake them off, then toned himself down, stopped struggling, and then calmly withdrew his arms from their grips. It was like pulling the sword out of the stone. “I’m fine. I’m fine,” he muttered.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Joe turned around to reveal Kevin, nose bleeding, looking angrily at Tom. “Fucking prick,” Kevin spat.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Tom ignored him and walked in a circle around a few of the tables, thoughts that weren’t really thoughts, just static garbage, running through his mind. He stopped and in one final burst of anger tried to flip over a table, though it was too heavy and barely lifted off the ground. It had more of an effect on Tom, almost pushing him down. Frustrated by this last failure more than anything, he pointed at Kate, who was still standing where she had been, frozen, hand against her mouth in shock. She looked like a deer in headlights. “You,” he commanded. “We’re going together. You’re coming with me,” he ordered, and turned around, going through the back door of the room without looking at the others once.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Through it there was another metal staircase like the one he had arrived down, and beside that a door. The compartments next to it said K and T. Tom walked up to the T compartment and thrust his arm into it, but nothing happened. He tried again, but still there was nothing.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">He put his head on the top of the compartment and closed his eyes tightly, tears seeping through his eyelids. He wanted to scream. He punched against the solid, stone wall once, twice, thrice, before withdrawing and shaking his hand, small specks of bloody skin flying off to the ground.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">He did not know how long he was waiting there for until the door behind him opened. He looked up, half-expecting to see a vengeful Kevin, only to see Kate, who was smiling nervously. “Um,” she said. “I suppose we should go through, then?”</p>
