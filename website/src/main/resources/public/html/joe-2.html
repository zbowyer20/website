		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">When the hole was big enough he clambered through it, with Sophie tugging harshly on his arm and pulling him through. The room on that side was almost identical to the one he’d come from – stalls with no toilets, sinks, but no urinals. As he came through he found that he was surprisingly tired. The lighting, maybe, was what was making his eyes droop. He stood up straight, about to thank Sophie for the assistance, when Victoria came rushing in, beads of sweat glistening on her forehead and a dusty hammer with a long, wooden handle in her hand.</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">“Ye can use this!” she shouted proudly before seeing Joe. “Oh. You got him through,”</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">Sophie held up her fists. “These bad boys can do anything,” she bragged, then looked at Joe. “So then, big gay Joe. It’s been some time,” she said. Victoria laughed in wonderful ignorance at the name and Joe stared back in horror at Sophie’s big grin. When he didn’t say anything, she continued. “I hear you got Tom to punch Kevin downstairs. Gutted I wasn’t there to see that,”</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">Joe had forgotten Sophie could be this way at times. “I really didn’t mean for that to happen,” he said sadly.</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">“Oh, Joe, we know, don’t we?” Victoria laughed, tapping him on the shoulder. “It were all Tom down there,”</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">“What ever did happen with you guys anyway?” Sophie asked, humour gone from her tone now. “I mean, everyone knew,” she said. “It wasn’t a secret or anything,”</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">“Everyone knew what?” Victoria asked, still smiling.</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">Sophie looked at Victoria and opened her mouth, prompting Joe to cut her off. “It’s nothing. Something that happened a long time ago,”</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">Victoria’s smile disappeared and she looked between Joe and Sophie, who was raising her eyebrows suggestively at Joe. “Alright, what’s going on ‘ere? You both know something I don’t,” she said, pointing the hammer at them as she did so. “You ain’t leaving until you tell me everything,”</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">“You really didn’t know?” Sophie asked. “Oh come on,” she said, glancing at Joe. “She doesn’t know?”</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">Joe shrugged, looking at the exit, wondering if he had been better off on his own.</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">Sophie seemed to at last get the hint and, rolling her eyes, walked past Victoria. “Whatever. Everyone knows anyway,” she said, brushing Victoria’s weak arm out of the way.</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">“Sophie!” Victoria complained, rushing out after her.</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">Joe turned to himself in the mirror and pressed his palms against his eyes harshly, so that it began to hurt. Everything was really getting to him all at once.</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">The picture had said he will speak again. Those words had haunted Joe through his entire life. He will speak again. He had lost love, friendship and family because of those words. He could recall something that one of his brothers had said to him.</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">No matter what you do, wherever you go, there will always be something to stop you. I don’t know what that will be. Sometimes it might be dad. Sometimes it might be your enemies or even your friends. But I think that the main thing stopping you, Joe, will be yourself. The only limits you really have are those that you impose on yourself. So if you can stop doing that to yourself you can be free. Joe, you have your wings, but you can’t use them if you won’t first jump out of the nest.</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">He pulled his head back from his eyes and looked back at his reflection through the black speckles that splashed around his vision as his eyes readjusted themselves. “What do you want?” he asked himself. “What do you want?” he repeated. Of course he knew what he wanted. He had always known. He had just been too scared to take it, or even accept it. The scariest things in the world were not what you could see with your eyes, they were what you could see with your mind, what your mind told you could be lurking in the future.</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">Joe shook his head. He could not allow his fears to dictate his future. If he focused on his fears then they would come true. Instead, it was time to change. Fuck he will speak again. It was time to walk his own path instead of the path somebody else had forged for him.</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">He walked, head held high, out of the bathroom. Sophie and Victoria were walking down the corridor, passing cells just like the ones on the other side of the floor. “Victoria,” Joe called out. “I have to tell you something,” he said, and walked to them. Victoria looked at Sophie briefly.</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">“You gonna tell me what’s been goin’ on?” she asked.</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">“Yeah. I am,” Joe nodded, feeling like his heart was in his throat. Blood surged around his body on full red alert. “It’s Tom. And me. We were together, before. For a long time. And then I stopped it. I was horrible to Tom and I hurt him and that’s why everything with us all kind of went downhill. It was me. I broke us all apart,” he said. Victoria looked at him with wide eyes, then slowly opened her mouth. In that instant of silence, a dread cloaked Joe as though it were strangling him.</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">“This, uh…” Victoria said, looking at Sophie who was smiling. “Oh, Joe,” she grinned, slapping him on his arm. “I know! Soph just told me!” she chuckled.</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">“What?” Joe asked, jaw dropping without even realizing it.</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">“Oh, she told me already. I did not expect that ya know! I had my suspicion about Tom but thought there were something there with Kevin! Not you! I still can’t believe you’re gay. Big gay Joe! Ha!” she laughed. “Don’t worry. Yer secret’s safe with me,”</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">“You already knew?” Joe asked. “What!” he looked at Sophie.</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">She brushed him away, shaking her head. “Oh come on Joe. Everyone knew. It was obvious,”</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">“I didn’t know,” Victoria interjected.</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">“I can’t believe it!” Joe said, hands on his hips. “Who else did ya tell!”</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">“Nobody. Nobody!” Sophie said. “I thought it was obvious!”</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">“Oh my god,” Joe sighed, hand on his forehead. “Oh well. Oh well! I guess it’s a good thing! I’m going to sort things out with him when I see him. I… still like him” he said. It still felt strange to say these secret feelings out loud.</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">“Yer getting together again!” Victoria said, clearly excited by the prospect.</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">“I don’t know. Maybe,” Joe suggested, feeling that the change in direction was all very sudden. His future seemed very unclear.</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">“Oh, this is exciting! I want to see you two kiss!” Victoria gushed.</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">“Nice,” was all that Sophie had to say.</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">“Look, uh… how about we get out of here. So I can see Tom then,” Joe suggested awkwardly and Victoria nodded enthusiastically.</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">“We got a key! We found a key in the bathroom. Now we can get through to the next room!” Victoria grinned. Sophie held up a small, shining padlock key as evidence. “C’mon!” she said, turning around and walking away.</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">“Alright,” Sophie said, following her.</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">Joe watched them walking away and, when they were out of earshot, breathed a deep breath. It hadn’t been so bad after all.</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">Ready at last for what could be the next stage of his life, Joe moved on.</p>

	<section class="story__section">
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">For the first time since his arrival to the prison, Joe came across natural light. While the last corridor had been windowless, it had been lit by tiring yellow lights. The corridor the group moved into was, on the other hand, unlit by bulbs but there were three small rectangular beams of white sunlight sitting on the stone floor in front of them, each beam coming from a separate cell. At the very end of the corridor, past the three cells, Joe could just about make out the outline of an open gate.</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">“Let’s check these out,” Sophie said, nodding to the cells. “I’m not wasting time backtracking if there’s a key or code or whatever in these,”</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">“Sure,” Joe agreed, and the three walked into the first cell. It was small and square with only a very thin window on the opposite wall from the door. </p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">“What’s up there, Joe?” Sophie asked, and Joe went on his tiptoes to look through the window. He shrugged – they were too high up. He could only see a depressing, cloudy day outside. There was no indication of any nearby buildings or anything at all that might give a hint as to their location.</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">“Ay, let’s go to the others. Ain’t nothing in ‘ere,” Victoria said.</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">“I’m gonna keep on looking. It’s too dark. You look in the others,” Sophie said.</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">Victoria and Joe moved out of the cell and towards the next one – here Joe noticed that there was a large number ‘2’ on the outside wall of the room next to its open gate, but he did not say anything.</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">“I’ll look in the next one,” he said, leaving Victoria in that cell and moving on to the last one, which was also labeled with the number ‘1’.</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">It was the same as the others; there was a thin window but not much else. He wandered to the corners, which weren’t lit at all, and did not expect to find anything. However, in the last corner his foot hit something and, curious, he bent down to pick whatever it was up.</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">It was a coil of rope and it hadn’t been there for very long. The rope wasn’t frayed at all, nor was it dirty. Joe picked it up, looping it around his right elbow, and left the room, calling for the others, but they did not respond.</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">“Guys?” he asked, peering into room 2. Victoria was not there. He moved to the other room, which he saw then was also labeled with a ‘3’, and yet Sophie was not there either. “Guys?” he repeated, turning around to look at the open gate at the end of the corridor. He had not seen the girls go past but did not know why they would have gone back the way they had come. “Are you there?” he asked out loud, wondering if he was being pranked again. He walked forward and passed the dark gateway. He could not hear a thing.</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">He took a few steps in complete darkness before seeing a speck of light from below him. He had come to the end of the corridor; to both his left and right there were wooden steps going down, and in front of him the corridor continued slightly onwards until it came to an abrupt end at a brick wall. Joe took the steps down, the light growing brighter, and the steps joined on to a lower platform where a tall window looked out. Joe looked through the window and was finally able to get some idea about where they were.</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">There were a number of small buildings all around them and cars scurrying between them. Wherever they were, it was not a deserted area – but it was also not an area that Joe was familiar with. It felt to Joe like he was within reach of civilization, but there was somebody blocking his grasp. Just below the window was some sort of courtyard that was bordered by a very high, dull grey stone wall. In the courtyard there was a brown shed that looked like some sort of new addition. There was also, on the far wall, a gate. If he could get down there then perhaps they could escape through the gate…</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">Joe turned and ran back up the stairs, calling for Sophie and Victoria, but still he did not get a response. He dashed through the open gate towards the numbered rooms, coiled rope still hooked on his elbow though he had forgotten about it, and then he was tripped up.</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">He fell straight down on his chest, face hitting the icy floor. “Ow…” he moaned, turning to his side. He had expected to see Sophie – she was the prankster, after all – but it was just Victoria. “That hurt…” Joe complained.</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">Instead of laughing or making a joke or even apologizing, Victoria kicked Joe in the chest, throwing him on to his back and taking the air out of him. He clutched at his stomach – she was stronger than she looked – and looked up at her in confusion. He opened his mouth to say something – asking why, calling for Sophie, saying her name – but in a flash she had fallen down to her knees and was on top of him. It was then that he saw the hammer, and whatever he was about to say turned into a cry for help, but he did not have time; she raised the hammer and slammed it down against his ribcage, sending him flying into an onslaught of pain, blood and saliva washing up his throat, but she did not hesitate and did it again, and black stars began to sparkle in Joe’s vision.</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">She sat up and wrenched the rope from Joe’s elbow. Through the pain Joe felt the rough, needle-like grip of the throat tighten as Victoria wound it around his neck. With every loop she made, he struggled to breathe through the blood in his lungs. He did not even try to speak.</p>
		<p class="story__text story__paragraph">As she made the final ring around his neck and tied the rope, Joe was able to look straight into her eyes. They were glazed over with a blue tint, as though she were bleeding from the brain and it was leaking into her eyes, but with blue blood instead of red. Then the blue lost its saturation, as did all things, and then Joe did not see anything else.</p>
