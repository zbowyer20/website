		<p class="story__paragraph">“Is she okay?” Kate asked, rubbing her fingers together without realizing it below her waist. She nibbled on her lip and surprised herself when she tasted the metallic tang of blood on her tongue. Tom tried to touch Sophie by leaning through the window, but he couldn’t reach her at a good angle.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“I’m gonna go in,” he said securely, and hoisted himself through the window, landing softly in the narrow gap between the bed and the wall on the other side. Now Kate heard a soft repetitive beeping coming from the other side of the bed – and so did Tom. He leant over Sophie to find the source of the noise. “It’s some sort of machine,” he said, an observation more to himself than to Kate. “It’s connected to her back,” he said.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Connected to her?” Kate asked, shuddering, a foreboding feeling drifting over her skin.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Tom ignored her, instead placing her fingers on Sophie’s wrist. Kate could see that she was alive – her chest was rising slowly up and down in what could have been a mechanical rhythm, and she could hear alongside the beeping the hoarse sound of Sophie’s throat as air struggled to make its way through it. Nevertheless, Tom took her pulse and, after initially struggling to find it, nodded. “She’s fine,” he said. “She’s alive. But what’s going on here…?”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Before Kate could think about Tom’s rhetorical question, there was a click from behind her. She turned around and saw nothing in the courtyard. Something in her told her to look up, though, and when she did she saw something that had not been there before. There was a window several floors up on the building that must have stretched across almost the whole height of the floor. She had not noticed it because the wall behind the window was the same boring grey of the building it belonged to. Now, though, there was someone in front of that wall, behind the window. Now Kate noticed it. That someone was Victoria – Kate could tell that much even from this distance – and she appeared to be simply looking over the garden, maybe even watching Kate and Tom. In an unsettling way she did not move.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Tom…” Kate breathed in a hushed voice. “It’s Victoria. Victoria’s up there.”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“What?” Tom asked.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">There was another click, louder this time, and something dropped from the panel above Victoria’s window. It was tall but thin, attached to a rope, and as the rope dropped its entire length and pulled taut, the thing attached to it made a snapping sound Kate had never heard before. It bounced back up in the air slightly then dropped down, still hanging a long way up from the ground.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">She must have realized subconsciously what it was before she really knew it, because the mere sight of the body hanging from the prison made Kate want to retch. She looked away from it for a moment but something drew her eyes back to the hanging corpse. Perhaps it was because it was something she had never seen before; perhaps it was because she really did know exactly what – exactly who – she was seeing.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">The figure was wearing a plastic black bag over its head, masking its face, but it had not changed clothes since the last time Kate had seen it. It wore a long grey shirt with the sleeves turned up to the elbow and dark, slim, denim jeans. The polished, long black boots now hung lifelessly, limply pointing towards the ground.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Tom could tell from the guttural sounds that Kate was making that something was deeply wrong, so crawled away from Sophie and leant through the window to see for himself. Following Kate’s gaze to the hanging man, he too knew what was happening. He could see that the dead person was the one he loved, the man he had loved since the day they had met.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Kate fell to her side, retching now, acidic bile washing up her throat and, though it burnt her mouth, she did not throw up. Tom scrabbled through the window and misjudged his feet, falling through it and landing on his chest, straining his back as his feet remained locked inside the shed. He pulled himself forwards, letting his legs drop from the shed, and then pushed himself up, running towards the hanging man as though there were anything that could be done now. “No, no, nooo,” he moaned, limping slightly.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">There was a snapping sound of something giving up entirely and Joe’s body came hurtling toward the ground. Kate gasped, not able to perceive the horror in front of her eyes, and willed herself to close them but found that she was completely unable to, as though somebody were prying her eyes open. Tom had to jump out of the way to dodge Joe’s body, already heavy with rigor mortis, which hit the ground just in front of him with a merciless thump, but it seemed like no time passed before Tom was above Joe, rolling him on to his back and whipping off the bag covering his head.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“No no no no no no no no no no,” Tom repeated, carried on repeating, while he futilely checked Joe’s pulse, couldn’t find anything, put his ear against Joe’s neck, but there was nothing to find, nothing there, but he didn’t stop, but Kate could tell already that there wouldn’t be a happy ending. There was no mechanical movement of the chest, no sound from the throat. Though Joe was not yet blue, he was gone, he was dead.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Tom refused to believe it, thrusting down on Joe’s chest, desperate to hope that he could wake Joe up as though he were simply asleep and dreaming, and he breathed into Joe’s mouth, a move he’d learnt from binge-watching television but there was nothing else he knew to do. “Come on!” Tom cried, thrusting down on Joe’s chest again, and getting violent now, shoving into Joe’s chest, but the man did not react, and then Tom punched him, screaming, “You can’t do this to me! Not now! This isn’t fair! This isn’t fair!” Kate felt the need to do something to stop Tom, to drag him away from Joe, to tell him that there was nothing that could be done, to let him cry on her shoulder, but she was unable to move, tears streaming from her eyes.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Tom stopped talking and shook his head, sobbing, and then resumed punching Joe’s chest. “Fuck you! Fuck you!” he yelled. Kate could not bear to watch any longer, so she looked up at the window to see that Victoria had vanished.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Victoria,” she moaned, pointing up.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">In spite of his grief, Tom seemed to pay immediate attention to her. “What?” he asked, an excess of saliva in his mouth smothering his speech.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“It was Victoria…” Kate rasped. “She was up there… she was watching…” she said, pointing to the window.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Tom followed Kate’s finger to the window and stood up on his shaking legs. “Victoria,” he muttered, nodding. “Victoria,” he repeated. He breathed out once, and walked towards the building calmly, then broke out into a run, soon disappearing back inside the prison.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Kate did not follow him. Her eyes fell back down to Joe and she became overwhelmed with tears again. The good ones always went first, but maybe that was why they went first. Finally she stole her gaze away from him and was able to cover her eyes, submerging herself in the comfortable darkness her own hands provided. He had just been a character in her story, but maybe he hadn’t been.</p>
