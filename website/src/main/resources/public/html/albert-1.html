		<p class="story__paragraph">There were many things that could have woken Albert. The strained groan of the rusted, iron bedframe as he was placed on to the hospital bed could have woken him, but it didn’t. The scraping of the door as it closed could have woken him, but it didn’t. The low, dull drone that started soon after he was left in the room could have woken him, but it didn’t. Only when that drone faded away, like the last specks of steam flickering out on a window, after which a heavy coldness descended upon the room, was Albert at last awoken.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">His face creased in confusion as icy breath tingled into his lungs and he wearily rubbed the sleep out of his eyes. They gradually crept open, hazel brown gems struggling to make sense of their surroundings. Albert turned his head, searching further for familiar sights, and twisted his stiff neck. It felt as though he had been asleep for weeks.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">He sat up groaning, more awake now, more aware of where he was, and he had no idea where that was. He was in a bedroom – the bed he was on and the bed a few feet to his left confirmed that, and the desk to his right with a set of belongings sitting on it suggested that it was a sort of living space. It certainly wasn’t his bedroom, though. Albert looked around the room again, trying to find something that would trigger his memory. He’d had some crazy nights at university – one memorable (in spite of all the alcohol) night with a random cute French student, Carlosita, came to mind – but he’d never quite forgotten the whole night enough to not know where he was the following morning.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Albert frowned and nodded in approval. Even though he’d been out of university for over two years he was still having incredible nights. He didn’t expect that the same could be said of many other ex-students. Nevertheless, he did find that his eyes went straight to the door; something about the situation made him uneasy.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">He swung his legs out of the bed and noticed the other single bed beside his, fully made. In a way it looked as though it had never been slept in. Given the objects in the room – the beds, the chest of drawers between them, the desk at the side of the room – Albert would have guessed that he’d gone back to a girl’s dorms and stayed there for the night, but he wasn’t aware of any universities where people still shared rooms. He was sure that was more of an American thing, an arrangement that had been abandoned long ago in the interest of privacy. Besides, there weren’t any universities in the town he resided in anyway. Perhaps he was in a hostel? The place looked far too dingy to be a hotel or even a Travelodge.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">He walked towards the door and noticed a flash of movement to his right. He paused and turned to see his own figure looking right back at him. There was a full-length mirror stuck to the wall beside the desk and Albert immediately fell into his usual routine of checking himself out when coming across any reflective surface… any reflective surface at all.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">It didn’t look like he’d slept with anyone purely because of the fact that he was fully dressed, overdressed even. He was wearing his big blue bubble coat that’d protected him from rain for years and never seemed to retain dirt. Most importantly, his signature green cap was perched on his head, backwards in the way that a ten year old boy at his first baseball game would do to be a part of a pre-adolescent group doing just the same. Over the years Albert had endured many friends and parents alike berating the cap – Albert wore it in the rain, the sun, inside and out – and asked why if he had to wear it, he had to wear it backwards. Albert had never really had an answer for that. It was just his thing, his image, a part of his persona. His cap was just as much a part of him as his arms and his feet and his eyes.  If Albert was without his cap, he wasn’t really Albert anymore.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Vanity accomplished, Albert stepped over to the door and pushed against it. It didn’t budge. He tried pulling against the doorknob, then pushing again, and yet the door would not open. He twisted and turned the doorknob, fears growing in his heart, before giving up. There was a square glass panel in the door and he looked through it; however, the other side was completely dark and he could see nothing. Albert frowned and nibbled on his lip. Somebody had locked him in the room. It suddenly seemed like he was less waking up from a dream and more being trapped in a nightmare.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">He slammed his fist against the glass panel and shouted. “Hello? Is there anybody out there?” he asked, but no response came. He pressed his face against the glass once more, looking for signs of movements, but there were none. He groaned.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Perhaps he was simply being pranked. Albert recalled that after a prank on his friend, Spongy, involving a somewhat nauseating albeit creative batch of soup, he deserved a joke being played on him in equal measure. Of course, there was a notable difference between being locked in a strange room with amnesia and finding an unpleasant surprise in your evening meal that would provide a night’s worth of ramifications.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Spongy?” Albert called out regardless. “Is this you? Look, I’m sorry about the soup thing!” he continued. Spongy did not reply, and nor did anybody else.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Albert swung around and in doing so hit his hand against a box that jutted out from the wall. He frowned down at it, cursing the strange thing for bruising his freezing hand. There appeared to be two segments to it: there was one long box, looking merely like an extension of the wall, and below that a gap, and below that another, smaller box that extended from the wall. Looking closer, Albert saw that there was a dark hole in the wall where the gap was, just wide enough that he could extend his hand – perhaps his arm, too – into it. If the hole was big enough, it could even come out to the wall on the other side of the door. Albert stared down at it, and tried to look through the hole, but like the glass in the door he could not see anything on the other side. It was unusual – what was its purpose? – and so Albert took a step back, not willing to risk putting his whole arm into whatever awaited on the other side. Perhaps it was overly fearful of him, but Albert’s instincts were screaming at him that it was a bad idea and so he took a step back from the hole and turned around to look back at the room.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">He saw now that hanging almost directly above the bed he’d woken on was a small whiteboard. There was no pen attached to it but there was a message written freshly on there, and it said:</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph story__paragraph--notice">
			He who controls the past controls the future.<br />
			Who controls the present controls the past.
		</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Albert recognized the quote – he knew it well. It was from George Orwell’s 1984, one of his favourite books, but the reason it was written there mystified him. Perhaps whoever owned this room was an Orwell fan as well.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Albert stepped over to the desk beside the bed and saw that there were a number of items placed on it, the most notable of which were three tealight candles, glimmering with a faint flame. He hovered his hands over the fire, hoping to warm them up even if just a little, but no heat was given off by the flames. They were so small that the candles may as well just not have been lit. Behind each of the three candles was a picture frame, in which was a picture of a different girl. All three girls were young, smiling fresh-faced into the camera, their heads taking up the majority of the space in the picture. Two were brunettes, one of which wore cute, black-rimmed specs, and one was blonde, her hair the colour of Hawaiian sand. There were small card nametags in front of each picture. The blonde was called Elizabeth, the glasses-wearing brunette Danielle and the other brunette Bree. Albert’s pulse began to quicken, and his fears continued to grow. The candles in front of these pictures did not seem to be a good sign. It looked like the desk was a shrine. This was not a desk that held pen and paper like that of a normal university student’s; this was something else entirely.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Albert swung around and made his way to the other side of the room. He saw that on the front of the metal bedframe, in a slot, was a clipboard with a piece of paper tacked to it. He pulled it out and gazed over it eagerly.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">It read, in neat, uniform handwriting:</p>

			Tests are ongoing but one subject, Sophie H., shows promising results. However, due to circumstances discussed previously it may be difficult to use her for our specific goals. We have, therefore, increased our sample with an additional four candidates, compensating for the three lost. They are:<br />
			- Maya L. <br />
			- Grace H.</br />
			- Joshua B.<br />
			- Albert S.</br>
			You will, as usual, be updated in our daily morning calls.<br />

		<p class="story__paragraph">Albert read and reread his name over and over again before resignedly taking a deep breath and dropping the clipboard on to the bed. He did not have long to think about the meaning of the letter before a sound of squelching, like of wet shoes in the rain, pierced through the silence behind him. He turned slowly, overcome by his fears, and saw that there was something happening in what he had believed to be the mirror.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Indeed, he did still see the reflection of the room he was standing in there, but events were happening in the reflection that were not happening to Albert’s surroundings. Thick, dark blue slime seemed to be bubbling through the floor in the reflection, and it moved with a life of its own, crawling over the floor and growing rapidly, before climbing up the bedframes and the wall. Albert could do nothing but watch with prayers that he was dreaming swimming around his mind. The blue goo seemed to be repelled by him, polluting everything in the mirror image but the space around Albert.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“What… the fuck…” Albert breathed.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">The squelching sound got louder and closer, until a fuzzy blue, static outline of a person flickered into view and out repetitively in the mirror. It was as though a person was approaching the mirror from the other side, and they got so close that Albert could even see their breath, transient and dull, creep on to the other side of the mirror. Gradually, a slight amount of colour and detail appeared on the person’s face; they had a petite frame but were definitely male, with smaller eyes and slightly darker skin – he looked Asian. The person squinted as though he too was trying to look through the mirror, and then he spoke.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Hello?” was all he said, and the voice was distorted, cracked as though being spoken when unwell.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Albert instinctively stepped back and as he did so, everything in the mirror disappeared, going back to normal, and Albert took another step back, falling on to the bed he had woken up on.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">He was breathing harshly, tears welling up in his eyes. He thought of his parents, proud of him, waiting to hear from their son, and of his aging border collie – Bobby – waiting patiently for him at his one-bedroom apartment. Now he wondered if these people who relied on him so much would ever see him again, and he wondered now what would happen to them.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">He sniffed and threw himself off the bed, turning to the door. He paced over to it aggressively and slammed his fist against the door. “Let me out!” he screamed, punching and kicking the door. “Where the fuck am I?”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">As though in response, the door clicked. Albert stood in shock briefly before abruptly turning the door handle. The door pushed open so easily that Albert had to wonder, perhaps hopefully, whether it ever had been locked in the first place.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">He stared out into whatever awaited him beyond the room. It was entirely dark there, but he could see the faint trace of something opposite the door. It was some kind of shining metal, a cluster of thin glows of light radiating from a shared center point.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Then a cold breeze descended on Albert and he realized that somehow he was not alone in the room.</p>
