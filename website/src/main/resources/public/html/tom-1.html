		<p class="story__paragraph">There are many things in the world to be afraid of. No matter where in the world you are, at what time, there is danger, whether you realize it or not. A grenade exploding in a trench in Normandy; a snake launching at a woman, alone in her garden; a dog on the other side of a door, snatching at your hand; a man, waking up alone in a place he has no recollection of.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Tom was entirely aware of the danger he was in and had at first been afraid. He had panicked, hammering on walls and yelling for help, and then had hidden and then, when it came to him that remaining still was keeping him trapped, he moved, and found the stairs, and there he found a friend, and then he was not afraid.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">She was banging on a door on the floor below him, shouting for Sophie, and as Tom lowered himself towards her, taking each step slowly, toes first then ball of foot, he could not help but smile. It was not a closed mouth smile. His mouth dropped open, well-maintained teeth glistening, and his dark brown eyes sparkled with happiness.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Sophie, can you hear me?” Victoria yelled at the door. After years of not having seen her, and in spite of the fact that it was probably he who was to blame for that, Tom found the Scottish accent he had almost forgotten a pleasure to the ears. He could almost not believe she was really there – not just for the fact that he did not know why he was there, but also for the fact that because it had been so long it felt as though she didn’t exist anymore. Did anyone or anything exist anymore if there was nobody to know it? If Tom did not know it?</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Victoria?” Tom whispered. He somehow almost regretted speaking. By interacting with her, would she disappear in a puff of smoke? Would she ignore him, not knowing he was there or not wanting to know he was there? For one instant she froze, and the fears that Tom did not want to believe almost seemed to come true. Then she turned around.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Her eyes widened and her mouth dropped open and she did not say anything. Tom had to admit that it was the most quiet he had ever seen Victoria, and wondered if she had forgotten his name. She disproved him.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Tom!” she cried, and her lips curled up into a huge smile. The anxieties bubbling in the pit of Tom’s stomach died down – she remembered him, she liked him. She was happy to see him. </p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">He raised his arms to his side, half in a gesture of I don’t know and half in a gesture to welcome her into a hug. She didn’t hesitate, rushing forward into a cuddle, burying her head into his shoulder. “I thought I were alone again!” she sniffed into his white T-shirt. “I thought I’d been left alone!”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“I’m here now,” Tom comforted her, closing his arms around her and rubbing the top of her back. “It’s really good to see you Victoria!” he told her, pulling back his head and gleaming at her.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Oh, Tom!” Victoria grinned, rubbing her forehead against his – Tom almost felt friction burn. “I missed ya, I did,”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“I knew that was you, from, from,” Tom began, and made a face, emulating her expressions as poorly as he would have expected of himself. He put on a terrible Scottish accent. “Your Glarsweejan accent, auch!” he smiled, proud of himself. The voice made something catch in his throat and he had to push back from Victoria, coughing to clear whatever it was. Victoria chuckled.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“You ain’t changed have ya. How long’s it been?” Victoria asked, smile wide on her face.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“It’s been long, it’s been way too long!” Tom exclaimed, then nodded to the door behind her. “I heard you shouting for Sophie? Is she here too?”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Victoria nodded enthusiastically. “Yeh! She’s here, she’s right behind that door, or…” she turned sideways, looking at the door. There was still no sound coming from it. “Or she was, anyway. She was right with me. Then the door closed and now I can’t hear her at all. Like she’s just gone ‘poof’ and gone away,”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Tom frowned and moved past her, pushing at the door and, when that didn’t work, put his ear to the door. “Sophie?” he called through, saying the words very clearly, but there was still no sound to be heard. “Sophie, can you hear me?” He asked. Nothing.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“She’s gone,” Victoria nodded, putting her ear against the door too.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Well, she can’t be far anyway,” Tom concluded, drawing back from the door. He placed his hands on his hips. “She’s been missing too, for quite a while. For over two weeks. I was getting quite worried about her, actually,”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“She said she’s been here all this time, she was in the same room as me,” Victoria agreed, remembering how useful Tom could be if he knew all the information.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“She’s been here. So she was taken. And whoever took her, well, now they’ve taken us,” Tom frowned. “This isn’t good at all,” He said, the worry growing in his voice.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Do you think this means the others’re here too?” Victoria asked. Tom was always the guy with the answers, ever since the day they’d met.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“The others?” Tom repeated, eyes widening. “You mean, like, Zak and…”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Zak an’ Kevin an’ Joe! If me you and Soph are here then maybe they’re here too, you know?” Victoria interrupted excitedly. “Maybe we’re all here together, you know?”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Tom shook his head. “It could be. I don’t know. Maybe you’re right,” he said, slowly nodding.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“It’d be nice to see everyone again,” Victoria shrugged. “It’s been a long time,”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“It has been,” Tom agreed.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Why’d we all stop talking anyway? I used to meet up with Sophie, she said something had happened with you an’ Kevin. Did something happen with you an’ Kevin?” she asked.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Tom shrugged. “No, not really. I mean I guess we just drifted apart. It happens sometimes,” He said. He turned around and went to the staircase. He could look right down the middle of the staircase to the bottom – it went down around the edge of the square tower-like room they were in – but between the floors there were metal gratings that were attached to the railing of a staircase on one side of the room and to that of a staircase on the other side. If he were to climb over the stair rail he would simply fall on the grating and perhaps roll, very uncomfortably, down to the stairs on the other side. “We should go down,” he suggested. “I went up and there was nothing there, just locked doors, so I think we need to go down,”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“We need to get outta here!” Victoria agreed, going to Tom’s side. “Do you think we’d be able to walk right out the front door?” she asked cynically.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Mmm. Well, there’s only one way to know,” Tom shrugged and bowled on forwards down the stairs. Victoria followed.</p>

		<p class="story__paragraph">As they walked down, Victoria tapped Tom’s shoulder. “Oh, Tom,” she said curiously. “Did you see a butterfly in a frame or something that had your name on it?”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Tom raised his eyebrows at the surprise question. “Er, no, what do you mean?” he asked.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Victoria shook her head, dismissing the idea right away. “Oh, nothing, it don’t matter,” she sighed.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">After a moment to process the confusion, Tom simply shook his head. “Riiiight. And I’m gonna skim right over that. Looks like we’re here,” he said. They had made it to the bottom floor and in front of them was dark metal door. To either side of the door were two compartments that jutted out from the wall.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“I know these!” Victoria exclaimed. “You put your hand in ‘em, and the door opens!”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Tom nodded. “Yes, I saw one too. But look,” he said, pointing at the letters on top of the compartments. “These ones say K and Z. My one said T, and I’m betting yours said V?”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Victoria nodded slowly. “You mean… these won’t work for us?”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“I don’t think so,” Tom agreed. “They took my blood. Did they take your blood too? I think the door will only open if certain people put their arms in them at the right time,”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Victoria nodded again. “So, K and Z – that means…!”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Yeah. It means, in all likelihood – Kevin and Zak are here too,”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“We have to find them!”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Look,” Tom pointed to the other door, to the left of the stairwell. Again there were two compartments. There were not letters on top of the compartments but rather there were asterisks. Tom approached the compartments. “I bet anyone can put their arm in this to open the door,” he said. “The asterisk means wildcard. So we can get through here,”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Victoria groaned. “There might be snakes in them holes,” she quivered.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Tom frowned. “Snakes? There were snakes in your hole?”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Victoria could not help but giggle. “There’ve been snakes in my hole before, yeah, Tom!”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Tom snorted, rolling his eyes, having missed Victoria’s humour. “Let’s just do it,” he said, and pressed his arm into the hole.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Victoria’s giggles faded away and, taking a deep breath, she too put her arm into the other hole. A sharp stab of pain took a drop of both of their blood and, in reward, the door between them clicked and opened up.</p>
