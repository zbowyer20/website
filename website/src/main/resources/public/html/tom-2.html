		<p class="story__paragraph">Even before he saw them he knew they were there. It wasn’t the sound of their voices, growing audible as the door opened, that made him aware of their presence either. As soon as the door opened just a fragment, Tom could feel them in a way that he always had, in a way that he hadn’t for a long time – or perhaps it was just the one person that he felt.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">The voices in the room – and, for Tom, all sound itself - came to a hush as Victoria slowly pushed open the door and Tom edged in behind her. The three men there paused and angled towards the door, frozen in anticipation. It was almost picturesque, the slow uncovering of the people there as Victoria walked forward, her body gradually revealing more and more of their old friends. First, above Victoria’s left shoulder, was the fluffy, straw-blonde hair, puffing out a little at the sides, which belonged to Zak. Victoria walked forwards and Zak’s ocean-blue eyes were there, round with surprise, and then she took another step and the whole of his round head, spiky at the bottom from his tobacco-like, light facial hair, was there. Zak raised his eyebrows at Victoria and then his eyes passed over her shoulder to meet Tom’s. He smiled at Tom. Tom smiled back.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Victoria was far enough ahead then that Tom could see over her right shoulder, and there he was: wearing his Legend of Zelda cap over straight, black hair was Kevin. Slightly shorter than Zak and wearing a loose-fitting zebra-patterned T-shirt, Kevin was the ‘Asian friend’ – there was one in every good group of friends, or so he used to say – who, apparently, was by nature a great cook, intelligent and an excellent friend to have. Tom had once agreed with that. Kevin met Tom’s eyes too.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">At that point while Tom was still hovering in the doorway, Victoria had made her way to the three guys and turned sideways, gesturing for Tom to come closer. As she did so she revealed the final piece in the puzzle. Joe, the tallest and broadest of the bunch by far, stood there, arms folded. He was darkly dressed in a blackish-grey shirt, matching his short, cropped black hair and dark eyes. Those eyes, too, locked into Tom’s. He smiled at Tom.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Joe’s voice, dashed with a light, friendly Birmingham accent, struck through the silence. “Hi,” to Victoria and Tom, at the same time, was all he had to say.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Tom swallowed. It was strange to see everyone again after so long. When everything had gone downhill he had been in pain for a long time. There had been tears, there had been shouting down the phone, and there had been bruises. After that he had given up to the fact that the friendships were forever stained, unsalvageable. It was like these people were merely characters in a story he had read long ago. Yet here they were, all of them except for Sophie, in the same room.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Tom joined them, giving a quiet “Hi” to Zak and passing a quick nod to Joe. The group was talking hurriedly, discussing their situation, Victoria explaining about Sophie and talking about butterflies, and Joe and Kevin and Zak giving their own, similar stories of waking up in a cell, but Tom could not focus. Thoughts of the situation he was in, the people he was standing with again, jolted through his mind like static, loud, electric shocks, keeping him completely unable to process more than a couple of words the others were saying at a time. Nevertheless, through all of this Tom was aware of Kevin’s gaze on him.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“You alright mate?” Joe asked, rocking Tom back into reality. Tom blinked, using the movement as a stepping-stone from discomfort to cheerfulness.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Not bad, not bad!” Tom responded, the first words to come to mind. “I’m not bad, how long’s it been now?” he asked, even though he knew how long it had been. He knew exactly how long it had been.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Yeah, we haven’t seen each other in a long time,” Zak chipped in. “Funny the circumstances, eh?”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Tom nodded rigorously before immediately toning it down, instantly regretting the obvious act that Kevin would so obviously be aware of. “Well, it’s sure nice to see everyone again, even though we’re… here… I guess.” He could not think of anything less awkward to say.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“How you been then?” Joe asked. It was how he had always started every conversation. He had not changed.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“I’ve been good, yeah!” Tom answered. They smiled at each other, a wave of terrifying silence between them. Tom, crushed by the quiet, felt a need to continue. “I’ve been good. Uh, been a while, huh… How about you?”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Joe smiled back – was that a suggestion of sympathy, of care, that Tom saw there? “I’m not bad. So did you wake up with Victoria then, or…?”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Tom opened his mouth to reply – then Kevin butted in. “We all woke up on our own, on different floors. Maybe that means something,” he cocked his head. Tom brought his right arm up to meet his left, which was already folded over his body. He clasped both of his elbows.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“No!” Victoria exclaimed. “I woke up with Sophie. We was in the same cell. She’d claimed top bunk an’ everything,” she explained.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Oh,” Kevin frowned. “There goes my theory,” he grinned at Joe.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“What were ya thinking?” Joe asked, large hand at his chin.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Oh, I don’t know… maybe they wanted to collect our blood separately, or something, but then we had to get our blood taken in pairs at the same time for this room. I thought it might mean something. I guess not,” Kevin shrugged.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Good theory anyway,” Joe commented.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Victoria pointed with her thumb behind them. “There were a door back there that said K and Z on it. Why didn’t you go through that one? You coulda gone through that one,”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Kevin shook his head. “No, we came through a different door,” he said, pointing to the side of the room. Indeed, there was a door there with the same compartments that Tom had seen through the building. “There was actually another door there, but it said T and K. If the letters correspond to us then that’ll be me and you, Tom,”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Tom smiled lightly and nodded wordlessly at Kevin, who looked back at Victoria immediately.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“We all got backpacks too. Same stuff in them,” Kevin mentioned. He patted the black strap of Victoria’s backpack. “Towel, water, same as you?” he asked.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Victoria nodded enthusiastically. “Yeah, a towel and some water!” she agreed.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Kevin let out a laugh that Tom found remarkably similar to the way a dog would let out a bark. “What’re we gonna be doing, going cross-country? A towel and water won’t get me doing that, ha ha… By the way, this dress is gorgeous, where did it come from?” Kevin gushed, adoringly looking at the dress.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Victoria smiled widely at the compliment. “It come off eBay!”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Wow, the bargains you can get on there! A few weeks ago, well a month or so I guess, there was this amazing set of—“</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Zak placed his hand on the bar that stood between the three of them and Tom and Victoria. “Okay, I think we can talk about our internet purchases later, like, when we get out of here. What do you think?”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Kevin squinted his eyes at Zak and made the ugliest duck face Tom had ever seen. “Spoilsport. But yeah, you’re right. Let’s get out of here,”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“What do you think—“ Joe began.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Joe, you and Victoria look behind the bar. Zak, you can check that corner – Tom, I want you with me, let’s go over there,” Kevin commanded.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Tom was stunned somewhat at Kevin’s decision. He looked straight at Kevin, who stared back at him with raised eyebrows. Bitch, you’re not getting away.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Frustrated, Tom walked forwards to the corner Kevin had decided on (Kevin always made the damn decisions) and, for the first time, actually saw the room they were in.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">It was some sort of lounge area, long and dark, lit from one end and dark at the other so much so that the other side of the room seemed to pale to insignificance. The lit area was the bar – Joe, Kevin and Zak had been standing drinks-side of it. It was small, a dusty wooden thing with only a couple of taps behind it and a duo of drinks cabinets behind it. Through the glass panels there had been a few bottles standing up, though Tom wasn’t sure if they were full. In front of the bar – where Tom and Victoria had stood – there were two wooden barstools, one of which had been unstable. Clearly the stools, and probably the bar itself, had been well used at some point.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Going away from the bar into the lounge area itself there was a number of round, wooden tables, each with two or three tall, almost regal, chairs with legs of ornate, golden wooden and cushioned with thick, mahogany leather. The tables largely had nothing on them, save for an unlit, white candle on a couple.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">At the end of the room in one dark corner – the corner Zak was to search – was a closed door, which Tom expected was the one the guys had arrived through. Stretching along the wall beside that door was a low shelf that held a variety of objects; there were books piled messily together, a number of board games stacked upon each other, pint glasses smeared with the fingerprints of previous users, a set of packeted condiments in a grey plastic tray. Perhaps, Tom thought, there would be something on that shelf that could help explain their situation; a leaflet detailing their location, or maybe a note from somebody who had been here before.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Maybe there’s something there that can help us,” Kevin suggested.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Mmm,” Tom said back almost instantly. He saw Kevin freeze for a moment and continued walking. He did not see it but he knew he could feel Kevin rolling his eyes at the back of Tom’s head before continuing to walk onwards. He’d come so very close to forgetting how many of Kevin’s mannerisms he despised.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“You look at the books, I’ll check out these games,” Kevin told him and Tom nodded rigidly, biting his lips closed as he followed Kevin’s orders. </p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Tom was surprised to see that he was very familiar some of the books. There was The Diary of A Young Girl by Anne Frank – that one had made him cry for hours, even though he’d known from the beginning what was coming. Then there was The Phantom of The Opera, for which Tom had once bought tickets to see in the West End; unfortunately, that plan had fallen through. Tom flicked through the books, searching for something of any interest; perhaps something would be underlined, or a piece of paper would fall out. There was nothing.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">There was one book standing right at the end of the set that had its front and back cover ripped off. The pages were yellowed and the spine torn so badly that the title was destroyed, and it seemed like the book would fall apart at any moment. Tom flicked through that book too, and he hit gold. There was a photograph of a child in a Halloween witch’s mask; lots of wrinkles, big round black eye holes, a long, crooked nose with a bulbous red wart protruding from the end. Tom studied the photo and looked at the back, but there was nothing. At that point he saw that there was a passage in the book that was underlined in dark blue biro:</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">He who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Tom looked behind the photograph and the quote, trying to understand the relation between the two, when Kevin spoke up.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Hey, check this out,” he said.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Tom looked over, immediately disinterested, to see that Kevin had pulled out one of the board games. Tom could quite easily tell which game it was. From the cards that were flipped up on both sides of the plastic red base, it was clear to see that the game was Guess Who. “What?” Tom asked, laying the book back down on the shelf.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Look at this,” Kevin said, and nodded at the cards. Tom went to his side and raised his eyebrows. All of the pictures on the cards had been replaced – with pictures of Joe, different in every one, and with a different name label on the bottom of the card. In one Joe was the same guy who was on the other side of the room, cropped dark hair and broad, the type of guy Tom had always really wanted to look like. The name under that said, as expected, Joe. Then there was another card, of a young boy, short dark hair, tiny frame. The name said Lewis. Another card: Joe, with long, dark hair, but small eyes, tiny eyes. That name said Jonathan. One other card that caught Tom’s eye: Joe, still, but with a different face shape. It was too thin, like he’d not eaten for days, and there was a long, horizontal scar that ran along the top of his forehead. This name said Caroline.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“The fuck does this mean?” Kevin grimaced. “Is someone messing about with us?” He wondered out loud. Tom frowned, squinting at the cards, confused at the cryptic messages they kept on finding. Then, impulsively, he flicked down the Joe card and looked straight up at Kevin – then raised his eyebrows provocatively.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Kevin, exasperated, slammed the game down on to the shelf – and did so with more power than he realized. The cards – every single one of them – flicked down. Kevin, surprised, looked down at the game – then stared back at Tom.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Tom, look, if we—“ he began, but was interrupted by an incredible loud smacking sound from the other side of the room. At almost the same time there was a yell.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“What the hell’d ya do that for?!” Joe howled. Tom and Kevin swung around, looking towards the bar where Joe had jumped back from Victoria, clutching his arm. Victoria was staring at her hand.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Got it!” Victoria announced proudly.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Tom and Kevin, accompanied by Zak, rushed back over to the bar. Victoria, eyes gleaming, showed the palm of her hand to them. There, a little bloody, was the corpse of a small butterfly with stubby grey wings. “It’s been buzzing about for ages!” she explained. “I finally got it!”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Gave me a bloody red arm too!” Joe complained, rubbing his arm. Specks of butterfly dropped off, drifting to the floor.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Gross,” Kevin scowled.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“You didn’t need to kill it, ya know,” Joe frowned.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“It kept fluttering around my face!” Victoria shrugged, raising her hands. </p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Remind me not to hang around you too much if that’s what ya do when something annoys you, then!” Joe raised his eyebrows, and then he looked at Tom, grinning. Tom sniffed out his laughter, naturally grinning back at Joe before coming back to himself again and looking away quickly.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">At that moment the door just behind them burst open and everybody turned around. In front of them was a girl with long, blonde hair with big, mouse-like brown eyes, wearing a beautiful, long red and white striped dress. She stumbled forwards, almost losing her balance, and adjusted herself, pushing herself backwards and almost losing her balance again. At last standing straight, she stood tightly, smiling nervously at the group.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Kevin stepped forwards. “And who are you?” He asked.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">The girl swallowed, nodded, and responded with, “Oh, hi. I’m Kate. Nice to meet you.”</p>
