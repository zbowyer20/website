		<p class="story__paragraph">In the moments before Albert was aware of another presence, the stranger remained calm and cool, aware and still. He was tall – much taller than Albert – but unnaturally so. His legs were slender, thin and long, and his arms drooped almost limply by his sides, descending further down his body than they should have. He wore a grey shirt, the sleeves rolled up so that they wouldn’t be spoilt when blood was spilt.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">His head, like his body, was long, and it was as though his skin didn’t fit his skull: his forehead was too narrow while his cheekbones were too wide, and his scorching blue eyes were buried deep into his head. A tuft of black hair like infertile soil grew like moss on the top of his head and his ears, misshapen and almost elf-like, pointed out on both sides.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">He watched Albert, pinpointing the exact location on the man’s cheek where the well-used hunter’s knife he was holding would stab. By the time Albert did turn and at last see the stranger, there was nothing more that Albert could do to save himself; the plan was already set in motion, the blade rushing towards its destination already.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">The stranger set upon Albert with a fluidity that implied experience, his arm rising in an arc as he pounced off the ground, a huge and powerful predator flying through the air. Albert had only enough time to turn around, attempting to flee, before the stranger landed on him, and just an instant later the blade pierced through Albert’s right cheek.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Albert fell face down on to the dark floor outside and instinctually yelled in terror, blood and spit hurtling from his mouth, and his cap flew off his head. The stranger landed on Albert’s back and pinned him down, and in the same movement withdrew the blade in his right hand from Albert’s cheek, leaving a bloody and raw gash that almost connected with his mouth, and took Albert’s fuzzy black hair with his left hand.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“This will not stop,” The stranger growled, and he slammed Albert’s head down. As Albert’s nose collided with the hard floor it shattered with a single crunch, and in a red flurry of flesh, blood and fear, Albert’s world went blank.</p>
