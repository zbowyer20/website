		<p class="story__paragraph">Kevin tugged at the door – the only entrance and exit to the room – but, as he had known, it wouldn’t budge, locked in place. As though in response to his attempt, though, there was a click and the door swung open when he pulled at it a second time. Though surprised by the outcome, Kevin had come to accept that things just happened here that he was not in control of and the best way to get out would be to play by the rules of the game. He fled from the room and heard clanging footsteps from above him as Tom ran up the stairs, still screaming like an animal.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Tom!” Kevin yelled, sprinting up the stairs after him. Though there were a lot of steps, he remained calm and focused, taking short, sharp breaths to maintain his endurance as he climbed level after level of the stairs. He was closing the distance between himself and Tom, who was still shrieking in what sounded like a mix of rage and tears, and it wasn’t long before he could hear Tom’s footsteps on the step directly above him, and then he could see the white of Tom’s shirt disappear on the other side of the stairs as they twirled around and around the square room, and then the screaming ceased and Kevin came to a skidding stop, almost running straight into Tom, who had frozen and was staring emotionlessly, silently, through the bars of a padlocked gate that barred him from the steps leading up to the next floor. On the other side of the gate, sitting midway up the stairs, head held down as if in shame or in prayer, was Victoria.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Tom!” Kevin hissed, taking in a sharp intake of breath to replenish his lungs after the unexpected exercise. “What are you doing now?” he asked. Tom did not answer, and did not even give any indication that he’d heard Kevin. He stayed still, eyes piercing Victoria through the gate. Kevin almost didn’t notice that tears were falling from his eyes even though Tom wasn’t making a sound. It was as though someone that turned the volume down to zero.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Trying a different tactic, Kevin slid past Tom and tried to open the gate, but the padlock was held on a chain that was tightly bolted to the gate and the stairs. “Victoria? What’s going on? Let me in,” he said directly, but Victoria also did not answer him; her head moved slightly, her hair swaying somewhat, but still she did not look up.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Kevin looked again to Tom. “What’s going on?” he asked, and this time Tom’s watery eyes met Kevin’s, but he did not respond. “Tom!” Kevin snapped, giving him a light shake. “Stop being like this for god’s sake!”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“She killed Joe,” Tom answered coldly, though his voice jutted.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“What?” Kevin asked, blood draining from his face.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“She killed him. She tied a rope around his neck and she killed him,” Tom gulped, eyes now going back to Victoria. “And now she’s hiding from us,”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“What?” Kevin repeated, shaking his head and rolling her eyes, dismissing it as Tom’s usual craziness. “Victoria?” he asked, but still Victoria did not look up. “Tom,” he said. “You’re fucked up, you know that?”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Tom’s top lip wavered and his head shook. “I’m not lying,” he said, pronouncing each word slowly. “She killed him,”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Though Kevin didn’t want to believe it, something about the paleness of Tom’s face, the empty look in his eyes, the way Victoria was so still, made Kevin sure that this was no joke. Somehow, everything had gone wrong.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Then Victoria looked up and opened her eyes. They were glazed over with an ice blue tinge, lighting up her irises in a way that made Kevin shudder. Tom bolted upright, alert. She opened her mouth and spoke, her Scottish dialect eerily removed. “This will not stop,” she said, then stood up, turned around, and ascended the steps away from Kevin and Tom.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“No. No!” Tom yelped, eyes following Victoria as though she were a target, his eyes planting the crosshairs on her. He pulled at the gate urgently, looking at Kevin needfully.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“It’s not gonna open. It’s got a padlock on there, see?” Kevin said, gesturing to the lock. Tom made a noise – some kind of bark – and his eyes darted around the room. Kevin followed his gaze to see where it finally landed on and both men had the same idea simultaneously. “Don’t be stupid,” Kevin said. Tom decidedly was stupid.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Tom jumped down the stairs, taking them two at a time, until he was a flight of stairs and a half below Kevin, directly opposite him. Tom swung a leg over the iron bars that were the balusters of the stairs. At the stairs between each floor, a rusting black iron grating sloped upwards from one side of the room to the other. Kevin was quite sure that this was so that there was never a huge distance to fall down if somebody fell – or, more likely, jumped – off the stairs. They were, he expected, suicide barriers, though he wasn’t confident that they would serve their purpose now. “Tom!” he yelled. “Don’t be stupid!”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Tom, as usual, did not listen to him, and without hesitation placed his foot on the bar, and then his entire body was on there. Kevin shook his head in frustration – Tom was always one to follow his heart, no matter where it led him – but the fear of losing another friend (even if it was doubtful that Tom could be considered a friend anymore) was enough for him to reluctantly climb over the barriers himself and join Tom in pulling himself up the steep grating. It creaked and Kevin closed his eyes, pulling himself forward in determination. Tom reached the highest part of the grating but still had to stand to reach up to the previously inaccessible part of the stairs. He wobbled, almost losing his balance, and Kevin watched fearfully as he regained his footing and dragged himself up to the stairs. He didn’t wait for Kevin, instead flying up the stairs in pursuit of Victoria. Kevin curled his lip, furious at himself more than anything for putting himself at such risk, and followed, eventually reaching the same point that Tom had used to reach up. He stood, almost losing his balance himself, not having realized how difficult it was to stand on a metal flooring at such a steep angle. He tried to reach up to the stairs but his fingers could just barely brush the bottom of the stairs. Taking a deep breath, and knowing that he had to do this quickly, Kevin jumped, the idea of what would happen to the grating if he crashed back down on it flashing through his mind, and his hands thankfully gripped the bottom part of the stairs’ barrier. Feeling somewhat excitedly like Lara Croft, Kevin hoisted himself up to the next part of the barrier, his arms feeling like they would break, and then he was over and on to the stairs. He lay on his stomach for a breath before jumping up to his feet and going in search of Tom, Victoria and whatever else awaited him.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">There was only one more floor to go up to – the ninth floor – and the door leading away from the stairs was wide open in front of him. Kevin gingerly walked through it, an unusual, cold fear creeping through him, and followed a corridor that was almost entirely dark through to a final door that was shut, a simple, single, silver handle sitting there as though it were begging to be used. Knowing that the scene on the other side of that door might not be pretty, Kevin gripped the handle, breathed in, and pushed open the door.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">He couldn’t push it forward very far, as something on the other side blocked him, though it didn’t exert too much resistance against his force, and with a bit of effort the thing on the other side moved for him. Kevin burst into the room, the brightest he had been in since he had woken up here by far. It was a long room with shining, plastic flooring that was grey with the hint of a pale blue and speckled with black static. Windows that were barred lazily – anybody could squeeze through the huge gaps between the bars – breathed blinding white light into the already glowing room, which was lit exaggeratedly with three long beams that ran across the whole length of the room. </p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">At the sides of the room there were three black, plastic chairs with silver legs and a back that looked so straight that a plane seat would be preferable over them. Next to both sets of chairs was a radiator, and Kevin noticed immediately that locked to one of the radiators was a set of handcuffs. At what was almost the other side of the room, looming in front of them in the middle, and what must have been the centerpiece of the room, was a table that looked as though it had been built into the room: exactly the same colour as the floor and rising from it with what looked like a slick, curved spine as though it were some sort of stalagmite. There were white and transparent wires and cables that grew up to the table from the floor like poison ivy, but they laid there on the table, not connected to anything. Behind the table, pressed against the back wall of the room, coloured like the floor, were a multitude of cupboards, and next to those, in the left corner of the room, placed there almost like an afterthought, was a door that seemed to merge into the wall. There was, standing at the cupboards, a man with his head in his hands, elbows standing on the worktop. He wore a long, white lab coat and the only other thing that Kevin could see was his dark, short hair, and yet he seemed strangely familiar and yet unfamiliar at the same time.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Tom was standing right next to him, silent, having been the thing that had been in the way of the door. Tom’s eyes were unmoving, set on the man. He looked like a stuffed animal. “Tom?” Kevin asked, pushing into him on his arm. “Are you—“</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“It’s him,” Tom wheezed, the traces of tears and saliva blocking his throat. “It’s him,” he repeated.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">The man at the front of the room turned around, seemingly only now noticing Kevin and Tom’s presence, and lifted his face from his hands. Though he had long, white scars on his cheeks and his nose looked strangely paler than the rest of his face, Kevin could not mistake who this person was: it was Joe.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Tom took a step forward, reaching his arm out, and Joe almost fell over to his side as he stumbled to move quickly. Tom froze. “Joe? Joe? What’s happening?” he asked, voice quiet and confused.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Joe shook his head sharply and violently. “No. Not Joe,” he said, and he had a voice that was somehow naturally slower than Joe’s, and deeper, without Joe’s usual Birmingham accent.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“What?” Tom asked, sounding like a lost little boy. Kevin felt his bottom lip uncontrollably twitch.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“I—I’m sorry,” Joe said, and then he ran to the door, opening it, letting in a stream of white light.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“No!” Tom screamed, moving immediately towards the door. It slammed closed with a firm bang that emanated a sense of finality, and almost at the same time Tom reached it. He pulled down against the handle but it didn’t open, and then he banged against the door, kicking it, yelling without saying anything. Then he said, again, “No!”</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Everything happened too quickly for Kevin. Tom swung around, shouting from the depths of his lungs, guttural sounds escaping his mouth, and with one astounding yell he flew at the cupboards, ripping them open, searching in them for who knew what. He scrabbled through them, first finding a first aid kit that he smashed against the worktop, sending the contents flying, and when he saw that there was nothing of any use inside it he resumed his search, moving then to the next cupboard where there were drinking glasses and vials, which he recklessly pulled from the cupboard in a rapid search to find anything he could use. They all smashed against the floor, sending shattered glass flying everywhere.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Tom…” Kevin said. Tom reached through the last of the cupboards then, and in mindless fury ripped the cupboard door from its hinges and threw it across the room. It smashed against the bars of a window and cracked down on the floor. Tom turned back towards Kevin then and with a tearful scream dragged his fingernails down the sides of his cheeks. He only drew blood with one of the scratches, a dribble of blood dropping down his cheek, the other scratched revealing glistening, raw pieces of flesh.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">“Tom,” Kevin repeated, his hand flying to his mouth, tears streaming from the corners of his eyes and yet fear paralyzed him in his place. Tom, crying hysterically now, ran towards Kevin, then seemed to stop in his tracks and flipped the chairs on the right side of the room in the air, all of them landing on their sides, and then he picked one up and repeatedly smacked it against the bars of one of the windows, then shoved the back of the chair through the bars against the glass, but it did not break. Tom tried and tried to break the glass but it was impenetrable, and so he withdrew the chair and threw it across the room. It hit the cupboards and landed in the corner of the room.</p>
		<p class="story__paragraph">Tom, truly exhausted in every way, fell to his knees, his face falling into his hands, and he sobbed hysterically into them, and then he turned around and huddled up to the cold radiator, putting his hands around the pipes to prop himself up against the wall, and he hung his head, tears dropping to the floor. Kevin, finally feeling that he could move, crept over to him and stood over him, silent tears falling down his own cheeks, and, feeling at a loss for what to do, fell down to his own knees and put his arm around Tom, who put a hand against Kevin’s chest and let his head drop on to Kevin’s shoulder, crying there, and Kevin did not know what to say. There was nothing that he could say. At once, all seemed so wrong with the world and it was as though there were no way to make anything right again.</p>
